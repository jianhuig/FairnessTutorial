\usage{
eval_eq_opp(
  data,
  outcome,
  group,
  probs,
  cutoff = 0.5,
  bootstraps = 1000,
  digits = 2,
  message = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe containing the actual outcomes, predicted probabilities,
and sensitive attributes necessary for evaluating model fairness.}

\item{outcome}{The name of the outcome variable in the data; it must be binary.}

\item{group}{The name of the sensitive attribute variable used to define groups
for comparison in the fairness evaluation.}

\item{probs}{The name of the variable containing predicted probabilities or scores.}

\item{cutoff}{The threshold for converting predicted probabilities into binary
predictions; defaults to 0.5.}

\item{bootstraps}{The number of bootstrap samples used for estimating the
confidence interval; defaults to 1000.}

\item{digits}{The number of decimal places to which numerical results are rounded;
defaults to 2.}

\item{message}{Logical; whether to print summary results to the console; defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item Metric: Describes the metric being reported (TPR for each group, difference).
\item Group1: True Positive Rate for the first group.
\item Group2: True Positive Rate for the second group.
\item Difference: The difference in True Positive Rates between the two groups.
\item CI: The 95\% confidence interval for the TPR difference.
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates the equal opportunity compliance of a predictive model
by comparing the True Positive Rates (TPR) across different groups defined by
a sensitive attribute. It is used to determine if a model exhibits bias
towards any group for binary outcomes.
